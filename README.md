# A/B Testing with Real-World E-Commerce Data

This project demonstrates a complete A/B testing workflow using simulated e-commerce data. It explores whether a new website variant affects user revenue and conversion behavior, while also showcasing statistical analysis skills including hypothesis testing, data visualization, and ANOVA.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - A/B Test Data by Sergylog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergylog/ab-test-data)
- **Variables:**
  - `USER_ID`: Unique identifier for each user
  - `VARIANT_NAME`: Indicates whether user saw the control or variant version of the site
  - `REVENUE`: Amount of money generated by the user

---

## Statistical Methods Used

- **Mann-Whitney U Test** for revenue comparison (non-parametric)
- **Chi-Square Test** for conversion rate difference
- **One-Way ANOVA** on synthetic `USER_TYPE` variable
- **Normality Testing** (Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
- **Data Cleaning** (duplicate removal, type conversion)

---

## Visualizations

- Boxplot: Revenue by group
- Swarm Plot: Non-zero revenue by user type
- Bar Chart: Conversion rates by variant
- Annotated statistical results

---

## Key Findings

- No statistically significant difference in revenue or conversion rate between the control and variant groups
- Synthetic user type groups also showed no significant variation in revenue
- Visual plots supported and illustrated all statistical test conclusions

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- A/B testing design and evaluation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Hypothesis testing with `scipy.stats`
- Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Clean code and logical structure for reproducibility

---

## Tools Used

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SciPy

---

## Future Extensions

- Add time-based analysis (if time data becomes available)
- Incorporate additional confounding variables for multi-factor ANOVA
- Apply bootstrapping for confidence intervals
